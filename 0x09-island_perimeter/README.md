# Island Perimeter

For the “0. Island Perimeter” project, you will need to apply your knowledge of algorithms, data structures (specifically matrices or 2D lists), and iterative or conditional logic to solve a geometric problem within a grid context. The goal is to calculate the perimeter of a single island in a grid, where the grid is represented by a 2D array of integers. Understanding how to navigate and analyze 2D arrays and apply logical operations to determine the conditions for perimeter calculation is crucial for this task.

## Concepts Needed

1. 2D Arrays (Matrices):

    * Accessing and iterating over elements in a 2D array.
    * Understanding how to navigate through adjacent cells (horizontally and vertically).
2. Conditional Logic:

    * Applying conditions to determine whether a cell contributes to the perimeter of the island.
3. Counting Techniques:

    * Developing a method to count the edges that contribute to the island’s perimeter.
4. Problem-Solving Strategies:

    * Breaking down the problem into smaller tasks, such as identifying land cells and calculating their contribution to the perimeter.
5. Python Programming:

    * Nested loops for iterating over grid cells.
    * Conditional statements to check the status of adjacent cells.
